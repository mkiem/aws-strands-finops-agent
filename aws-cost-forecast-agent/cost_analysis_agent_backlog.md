# FinOps Agent Feature Backlog

## 1. Enhanced Time Period Granularity

**Feature Description:**  
Enable more detailed time-based cost analysis by supporting DAILY and HOURLY granularity options in addition to the current MONTHLY view.

**Requirements:**
- Add a new parameter `granularity` to the `get_aws_cost_summary` function with options for "DAILY", "HOURLY", and "MONTHLY" (default)
- Update the Cost Explorer API call to use the selected granularity
- Format the response data appropriately based on the granularity level
- Add data visualization capabilities that adapt to the selected granularity

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
@tool
def get_aws_cost_summary(time_period="MONTH_TO_DATE", granularity="MONTHLY"):
    """
    Get a summary of AWS costs with flexible time granularity.
    
    Args:
        time_period: The time period (MONTH_TO_DATE, LAST_MONTH, LAST_7_DAYS)
        granularity: Data granularity (DAILY, MONTHLY, HOURLY)
        
    Returns:
        A summary of AWS costs with the specified granularity
    """
    # Implementation
```

**User Stories:**
- As a FinOps analyst, I want to view daily cost trends so I can identify specific days with unusual spending
- As a developer, I want to see hourly cost patterns to correlate spending with application deployment events

**Technical Considerations:**
- HOURLY granularity is only available for the last 14 days
- Higher granularity increases API costs and data volume

**Priority:** Medium

## 2. Multi-dimensional Cost Analysis

**Feature Description:**  
Expand cost analysis capabilities by supporting additional grouping dimensions beyond just AWS services.

**Requirements:**
- Add a new parameter `group_by` to the `get_aws_cost_summary` function
- Support the following dimensions:
  - LINKED_ACCOUNT (for multi-account setups)
  - REGION
  - USAGE_TYPE
  - INSTANCE_TYPE
  - OPERATION
  - PURCHASE_TYPE (On-Demand, Reserved, etc.)
  - TAG (for cost allocation tags)
  - BILLING_ENTITY
- Allow multiple dimensions to be specified (up to 2, as per API limits)
- Format the response to clearly show the hierarchical grouping

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
@tool
def get_aws_cost_summary(time_period="MONTH_TO_DATE", granularity="MONTHLY", group_by="SERVICE"):
    """
    Get a summary of AWS costs with flexible grouping options.
    
    Args:
        time_period: The time period (MONTH_TO_DATE, LAST_MONTH, LAST_7_DAYS)
        granularity: Data granularity (DAILY, MONTHLY)
        group_by: Dimension to group by (SERVICE, LINKED_ACCOUNT, REGION, etc.)
        
    Returns:
        A summary of AWS costs grouped by the specified dimension
    """
    # Implementation
```

**User Stories:**
- As a cloud architect, I want to see costs by region and instance type to optimize my infrastructure deployment
- As a finance manager, I want to view costs by linked account to allocate expenses to different departments

**Technical Considerations:**
- Maximum of 2 GroupBy dimensions allowed per API call
- Some combinations may require multiple API calls
- TAG dimension requires specifying which tag key to use

**Priority:** High

- Support filtering by:
  - Service names
  - Accounts
  - Regions
  - Tags
  - Usage types
- Allow complex filter expressions (AND/OR logic)
- Provide helper functions to construct common filters

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
@tool
def get_service_costs(services, start_date=None, end_date=None, granularity="MONTHLY"):
    """
    Get costs for specific AWS services.
    
    Args:
        services: Comma-separated list of AWS services to include
        start_date: Start date for cost analysis (YYYY-MM-DD)
        end_date: End date for cost analysis (YYYY-MM-DD)
        granularity: Data granularity (DAILY, MONTHLY)
        
    Returns:
        Cost data for the specified services
    """
    # Implementation
```

**User Stories:**
- As a product manager, I want to filter costs by my product's tags to understand its AWS spending
- As an engineer, I want to filter costs to show only compute services to focus my optimization efforts

**Technical Considerations:**
- Filters need to be properly formatted for the Cost Explorer API
- Consider caching filtered results to improve performance
- Validate filter inputs to prevent API errors

**Priority:** Medium

    """
    # Implementation with proper response structure including:
    # - forecast_by_period
    # - prediction_interval with upper/lower bounds
    # - metadata with confidence levels
```

**User Stories:**
- As a finance director, I want to see cost forecasts for the next quarter to plan my budget
- As a FinOps practitioner, I want to compare current spending trends against forecasts to identify potential overruns early

**Technical Considerations:**
- Forecasting accuracy depends on historical data availability
- Consider implementing both linear and ML-based forecasting options
- Cache forecast results to reduce API calls

**Priority:** High
