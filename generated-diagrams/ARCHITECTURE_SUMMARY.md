## Communication Patterns

### 1. WebSocket Communication Flow
```
User Query → WebSocket API → Message Handler → SQS Queue → Background Processor
     ↓                                                              ↓
Progress Updates ← WebSocket API ← Real-time Updates ← Agent Orchestration
```

### 2. Agent Orchestration
```
Supervisor Agent → Cost Forecast Agent (Cost Analysis)
                → Trusted Advisor Agent (Optimization Recommendations)
                → Combined Response Generation
```

### 3. Authentication Flow
```
Frontend → Cognito Authentication → WebSocket Connection → Post-Connection Auth
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Input Processing
1. User submits FinOps query via WebSocket
2. Authentication verification and user context establishment
3. Query queued for background processing with job tracking
4. Real-time progress updates sent to user

### Agent Coordination
1. Supervisor agent receives processing request
2. Parallel invocation of specialized agents:
   - Cost Forecast Agent analyzes historical and projected costs
   - Trusted Advisor Agent identifies optimization opportunities
3. Results aggregation and response formatting
4. Final response delivery via WebSocket

### Output Generation
1. Structured response with cost analysis and recommendations
2. Markdown-formatted content for rich display
3. Real-time progress updates throughout processing
4. Error handling with graceful degradation
