# FinOps Agent Development Summary - Date: 5/30/2025

## Project Setup and Configuration

1. **Logging and Command History**
   - Set up a pre_prompt hook in hooks.yaml to log chat interactions to chatlog.md
   - Created a command logging system that captures shell commands and appends them to chatlog.md
   - Added the command logger to ~/.bashrc for persistence across sessions
   - Created a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Verified and enhanced the existing Python virtual environment (.venv)
   - Confirmed Strands SDK installation (version 0.1.6) with necessary components
   - Installed additional dependencies for development (pytest, black, flake8)
   - Created a proper project structure with directories for agents, MCP servers, and tools
   - Set up configuration files and basic tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Created a Python script to consolidate Strands Agents SDK documentation into a single markdown file
   - Crawled approximately 50 pages of documentation, preserving links and formatting

## Design and Architecture

1. **Design Document Creation**
   - Analyzed AWS blog post about building a FinOps agent with Amazon Bedrock
   - Created a comprehensive design document for implementing similar functionality using Strands SDK
   - Defined a multi-agent architecture with Supervisor, Cost Analysis, and Cost Optimization agents
   - Outlined user stories for cost analysis and optimization features

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Selected AWS Amplify with React.js for the frontend
   - Chose AWS Lambda for hosting Strands SDK agents and MCP servers
   - Selected AWS AppSync for communication (avoiding API Gateway)
   - Defined a data flow and security considerations
   - Updated the design document with finalized architecture decisions

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Added development workflow instructions to hooks.yaml
   - Established a process for implementing, reviewing, and documenting changes

## Implementation Progress

1. **Phase 1: Core Agent Framework and Infrastructure Setup**
   - ✅ Step 1: Set up Strands SDK development environment
     - Verified existing setup and installed additional dependencies
     - Created project structure and configuration files
     - Added basic tests and requirements file
   
   - ✅ Step 2: Configure AWS Lambda for agent hosting
     - Created Lambda handler functions for all three agents
     - Implemented specialized tools for cost analysis and optimization
     - Set up AWS CDK infrastructure code for deployment
     - Added IAM permissions, error handling, and logging
     - Created deployment scripts and unit tests

2. **Next Steps**
   - Phase 1, Step 3: Set up AWS AppSync for communication
   - Phase 1, Step 4: Implement basic FinOps Supervisor Agent
   - Phase 1, Step 5: Create agent communication framework
   - Phase 1, Step 6: Develop basic natural language processing capabilities

## Technical Issues Addressed

1. **Strands SDK Access Issues**
   - Diagnosed and provided solutions for AccessDeniedException when accessing Bedrock models
   - Recommended updating IAM policies and configuring Strands Agent to use accessible models

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Created unit tests for Lambda handlers
   - Ensured proper error handling and logging
   - Verified configuration and dependencies
