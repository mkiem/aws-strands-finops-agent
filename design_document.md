## Backend Infrastructure

### Agent and MCP Server Hosting

#### Option 1: AWS Lambda (Recommended)
- **Strands SDK Agents**: Deployed as Lambda functions
  - Pros: Serverless, auto-scaling, cost-effective for intermittent usage
  - Cons: Cold start latency, 15-minute execution limit
- **MCP Servers**: Deployed as Lambda functions with WebSocket support
  - Pros: Simplified deployment, consistent with agent infrastructure
  - Cons: Potential limitations for long-running operations

#### Option 2: Amazon ECS/Fargate
- **Strands SDK Agents**: Deployed as containerized services
  - Pros: No time limits, more consistent performance
  - Cons: More complex setup, higher cost for low usage
- **MCP Servers**: Deployed as containerized services
  - Pros: Better for long-running processes, more control
  - Cons: Requires container management

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Strands SDK Agents**: Lambda for request handling
- **MCP Servers**: ECS/Fargate for specialized tools requiring more resources
- **Pros**: Balances cost and performance

### Communication Architecture

#### Direct WebSocket Communication (Without API Gateway)
- Use Amazon EC2 instances or containers with WebSocket servers
- AWS Application Load Balancer for WebSocket traffic management
- Pros: Lower latency, potentially lower cost
- Cons: More infrastructure to manage, security considerations

#### AWS AppSync
- GraphQL-based API service with WebSocket support
- Integrates with Lambda and other AWS services
- Pros: Managed service, real-time capabilities, security features
- Cons: Learning curve if team is unfamiliar with GraphQL

#### Amazon API Gateway with WebSocket API
- Managed WebSocket API service
- Integrates directly with Lambda
- Pros: Fully managed, scalable, secure
- Cons: Additional cost

### Selected Approach

For the initial implementation, we recommend:

1. **Agent Hosting**: AWS Lambda for Strands SDK agents
   - Provides serverless scalability and cost-effectiveness
   - Simplifies deployment and management

2. **MCP Server Hosting**: AWS Lambda with provisioned concurrency
   - Ensures consistent performance for tool operations
   - Maintains serverless benefits while reducing cold starts

3. **Communication**: AWS AppSync
   - Provides WebSocket capabilities without API Gateway
   - Offers robust security and authentication integration
   - Simplifies real-time communication between frontend and agents

This approach balances development simplicity, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while providing the necessary performance for a responsive FinOps Agent experience.
## Finalized Architecture Decisions

After careful consideration of various options, we have finalized the following architectural decisions for the FinOps Agent implementation:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify
- **UI Components**: AWS Amplify UI components
- **State Management**: Redux for global state management
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for cost data visualization
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito integrated with Amplify

### Backend
- **Agent Hosting**: AWS Lambda for Strands SDK agents
  - Provides serverless scalability and cost-effectiveness
  - Simplifies deployment and management
  - Will use provisioned concurrency to mitigate cold starts

- **MCP Server Hosting**: AWS Lambda with provisioned concurrency
  - Ensures consistent performance for tool operations
  - Maintains serverless benefits while reducing cold starts
  - Allows for specialized tools to interact with AWS services

- **Communication**: AWS AppSync
  - Provides WebSocket capabilities without API Gateway
  - Offers robust security and authentication integration
  - Simplifies real-time communication between frontend and agents
  - GraphQL interface for structured data exchange

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates via Amazon Cognito in the Amplify frontend
2. User submits a query through the chat interface
3. Query is sent to the FinOps Supervisor Agent via AppSync
4. Supervisor Agent determines which specialized agents to invoke
5. Specialized agents (Cost Analysis, Cost Optimization) process the request using their respective MCP tools
6. Results are aggregated by the Supervisor Agent
7. Response is sent back to the frontend via AppSync
8. Frontend displays the results in the chat interface and visualizes data when appropriate

### Security Considerations
- Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization
- IAM roles for Lambda functions with least privilege principle
- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits and updates

This architecture provides a balance of performance, cost-effectiveness, and operational simplicity while delivering a responsive and secure FinOps Agent experience.

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with Strands SDK
2. Create proof-of-concept for agent communication via AppSync
3. Implement basic FinOps Supervisor Agent functionality
4. Begin development of specialized agents and MCP tools
5. Initialize Amplify project for frontend development

With these decisions finalized, we are ready to begin implementation of the FinOps Agent system.
