Amazon EC2 cost optimization recommendations for instances\\n   - Status: Warning\\n   - Estimated Monthly Savings: $0.00\\n   - Affected Resources: 2\\n\\n5. Inactive NAT Gateways\\n   - Status: Warning\\n   - Estimated Monthly Savings: $0.00\\n   - Affected Resources: 2\\n\\nThe recommendations cover a variety of AWS services, including EC2, S3, and VPC. The top opportunity is related to low-utilization EC2 instances, which could potentially save $247.97 per month. The other findings have a smaller estimated impact, but are still worth reviewing to identify potential cost savings.\\n\\nTo act on these recommendations, I suggest reviewing the underutilized EC2 instances, investigating the S3 multipart uploads, and evaluating the inactive VPC and NAT Gateway resources. Implementing the suggested optimizations could help reduce your overall AWS costs.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need any additional details or have further questions!\\n\", \"agent\": \"TrustedAdvisorAgent\"}"}
