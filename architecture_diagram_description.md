# FinOps Agent Architecture Diagram Description

## Overview
The architecture diagram represents the AWS-based infrastructure for our FinOps Agent system, which uses Strands SDK and follows a multi-agent approach for AWS cost management and optimization.

## Key Components

### Frontend Layer
- **AWS Amplify**: Hosts the React.js frontend application
  - Provides CI/CD capabilities for frontend deployment
  - Manages environment-specific configurations
- **React.js Frontend**: User interface for interacting with the FinOps Agent
  - Chat interface for natural language queries
  - Data visualizations for cost analysis
  - Redux for state management

### Authentication Layer
- **Amazon Cognito User Pool**: Manages user authentication and authorization
  - Handles user registration, sign-in, and account recovery
  - Issues JWT tokens for secure API access
  - Integrates with Amplify frontend
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Defines permissions for various components
  - Lambda execution roles
  - AppSync service role
  - Cross-service access permissions

### Communication Layer
- **AWS AppSync GraphQL API**: Central communication hub
  - Provides GraphQL API for structured data exchange
  - Supports WebSocket subscriptions for real-time updates
  - Integrates with Lambda functions via resolvers
  - Secures access using Cognito authentication

### Agent Layer
- **FinOps Supervisor Agent (Lambda)**: Orchestrates the multi-agent system
  - Processes user queries and determines intent
  - Coordinates specialized agents
  - Synthesizes responses from multiple agents
  - Maintains conversation context
- **Cost Analysis Agent (Lambda)**: Specializes in cost data analysis
  - Retrieves and analyzes AWS cost data
  - Generates cost reports and forecasts
  - Identifies cost trends and anomalies
- **Cost Optimization Agent (Lambda)**: Focuses on cost-saving opportunities
  - Identifies underutilized resources
  - Generates optimization recommendations
  - Calculates potential savings

### MCP Server Layer
- **MCP Servers (Lambda)**: Specialized tools for agents
  - Agent Tools: General-purpose tools for the Supervisor Agent
  - Cost Analysis Tools: Specialized tools for cost data processing
  - Optimization Tools: Tools for identifying optimization opportunities

### AWS Service Integration
- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Source of cost and usage data
  - Provides historical cost information
  - Enables cost forecasting
  - Supports detailed cost breakdowns
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Source of optimization recommendations
  - Identifies cost optimization opportunities
  - Provides resource utilization insights
- **Amazon EC2/EBS/etc.**: AWS resources being analyzed
  - Target resources for optimization
  - Source of utilization metrics

### Storage and Logging
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Persistent storage for the system
  - Stores conversation history
  - Maintains agent state
  - Caches analysis results
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for static assets and data
  - Stores frontend assets
  - Archives cost reports
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
  - Captures Lambda function logs
  - Monitors system performance
  - Triggers alerts for issues

### Infrastructure Management
- **AWS CloudFormation/CDK**: Infrastructure as Code
  - Defines and provisions all AWS resources
  - Enables repeatable deployments
  - Manages infrastructure updates

## Data Flow

1. User authenticates via Cognito from the Amplify-hosted frontend
2. User submits a natural language query through the chat interface
3. Query is sent to AppSync GraphQL API with authentication token
4. AppSync resolver invokes the FinOps Supervisor Agent Lambda
5. Supervisor Agent analyzes the query and determines required actions
6. Supervisor Agent invokes specialized agents (Cost Analysis, Optimization) as needed
7. Specialized agents use their MCP server tools to interact with AWS services
8. Results flow back through the agent hierarchy to the Supervisor
9. Supervisor synthesizes a comprehensive response
10. Response is sent back through AppSync to the frontend
11. Real-time updates are pushed via WebSocket subscriptions
12. Frontend displays the results and visualizations to the user

## Security Considerations

- All communication is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/WSS
- Authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito
- Authorization uses JWT tokens and IAM roles
- Lambda functions follow the principle of least privilege
- Data is encrypted at rest in DynamoDB and S3

This architecture provides a scalable, secure, and cost-effective foundation for the FinOps Agent system, leveraging AWS serverless services to minimize operational overhead while maintaining high performance and reliability.
