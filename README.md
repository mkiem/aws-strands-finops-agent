# Development workflow
- Read the design_document.md implementation plan
- Think step by step and break down each line item even further and explain how you will execute it
- Get acceptance from the user
- Begin implementation only on the agreed scope
- Follow development best practices
- Once implemented, update the design_document.md to denote it's completed
