The AWS cost management system returned a DataUnavailableException, which means the savings plans utilization data is not accessible at the moment.\\n\\n### \\ud83d\\udcb0 Cost Optimization Recommendations\\n\\nTo help you identify optimization opportunities that could have the biggest impact on your costs, I would recommend:\\n\\n1. **Try Again Later** \\u23f0 - The savings plan data service appears to be temporarily unavailable.\\n\\n2. **Alternative Approaches** \\ud83d\\udd04:\\n   - Review your resource utilization directly in the AWS Cost Explorer\\n   - Check for idle or underutilized resources manually\\n   - Consider setting up AWS Budgets alerts\\n   - Review your Reserved Instance coverage and utilization\\n\\nWould you like me to help you analyze your current cost breakdown instead? This could provide insights into which services might benefit most from optimization. Or perhaps you'd like to look at cost forecasts to identify concerning trends?\\n\\n\\n## Optimization & Efficiency\\n\\n\\n\\nThe top cost optimization recommendation from Trusted Advisor is \\\"Low Utilization Amazon EC2 Instances\\\", with an estimated monthly savings of $247.97. This indicates that you may have some EC2 instances that are underutilized and could be downsized or terminated to reduce costs.\\n\\nThe other recommendations, while valuable, have a much lower estimated impact. The \\\"S3 Incomplete Multipart Upload Abort Configuration\\\" and \\\"Inactive VPC interface endpoints\\\" recommendations have $0 in estimated monthly savings, which means the potential cost savings are minimal.\\n\\nTo get the biggest impact on your cost trends, I would recommend focusing on the \\\"Low Utilization Amazon EC2 Instances\\\" recommendation first. This could involve reviewing your EC2 utilization metrics, rightsizing any underutilized instances, and/or terminating instances that are no longer needed.\\n\\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!\\n\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis analysis combines insights from 2 specialized agents. Review each section above for detailed recommendations and next steps.\\n\\n*\\u26a1 Analysis completed using parallel processing.*\", \"agent\": \"AWS-FinOps-Supervisor-Enhanced\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-06-15T01:02:09.000Z\", \"routing_metrics\": {\"agents\": [\"cost_forecast\", \"trusted_advisor\"], \"reasoning\": \"Fast route: Cost analysis and optimization query\", \"synthesis_needed\": true, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"routing_method\": \"fast_path_multi\"}}"}
