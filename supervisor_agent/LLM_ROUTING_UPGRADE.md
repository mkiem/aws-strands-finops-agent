# LLM-Based Routing Upgrade

## Problem with Previous Approach
The initial fix used **deterministic keyword-based routing** - an old-school approach that:
- ‚ùå Relies on rigid keyword matching
- ‚ùå Cannot understand context or nuance
- ‚ùå Requires manual maintenance of keyword lists
- ‚ùå Fails with natural language variations
- ‚ùå Cannot adapt to new query patterns

## Modern LLM-Based Solution
Following the AWS Bedrock Agent example, I've implemented **LLM-powered natural language routing** that:
- ‚úÖ Uses Claude 3 Haiku for intelligent query understanding
- ‚úÖ Understands context and intent naturally
- ‚úÖ Adapts to various query formulations
- ‚úÖ Provides reasoning for routing decisions
- ‚úÖ Includes confidence scoring

## Architecture Changes

### Old Approach (Deterministic)
```python
# keyword_classifier.py
cost_keywords = ['cost', 'spending', 'bill', ...]
optimization_keywords = ['optimize', 'save', 'reduce', ...]

def classify_query(query):
    cost_score = count_keywords(query, cost_keywords)
    opt_score = count_keywords(query, optimization_keywords)
    return max_score_category
```

### New Approach (LLM-Based)
```python
# llm_router.py
routing_instructions = """
You are an intelligent routing system for AWS FinOps queries...
Route to COST_FORECAST when queries involve:
- Current costs and spending
- Historical cost analysis
- Budget and forecasting
...
"""

def route_query(query):
    response = llm_tool.invoke(f"{instructions}\nQuery: {query}")
    return json.loads(response)
```

## Key Benefits

### üß† **Natural Language Understanding**
- Understands intent beyond keywords
- Handles complex, multi-part queries
- Recognizes context and nuance
- Adapts to user language patterns

### üéØ **Improved Accuracy**
- Context-aware routing decisions
- Handles edge cases naturally
- Reduces false classifications
- Better handles ambiguous queries

### üîß **Maintainability**
- No keyword lists to maintain
- Self-adapting to new query types
- Instructions-based configuration
- Easy to modify routing logic

### üìä **Transparency**
- Provides reasoning for decisions
- Includes confidence scores
- Explainable routing choices
- Better debugging capabilities

## Implementation Details

### LLM Configuration
- **Model**: Claude 3 Haiku (fast, cost-effective)
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (consistent routing)
- **Max Tokens**: 200 (sufficient for routing decisions)
- **Output Format**: Structured JSON

### Routing Instructions
Based on the AWS Bedrock Agent example, using natural language instructions that:
- Define agent capabilities clearly
- Provide routing guidelines
- Include example scenarios
- Specify output format

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to comprehensive analysis
- JSON parsing error recovery
- LLM service failure handling
- Confidence-based decision validation

## Files Created/Modified

1. **`llm_router.py`** - New LLM-based routing system
2. **`lambda_handler.py`** - Updated to use LLM router
3. **`test_llm_routing.py`** - Test suite for LLM routing
4. **`LLM_ROUTING_UPGRADE.md`** - This documentation

## Migration Benefits

### From Deterministic to Intelligent
- **Before**: "optimize spending" ‚Üí keyword match ‚Üí trusted_advisor
- **After**: "optimize spending" ‚Üí LLM understands intent ‚Üí trusted_advisor + reasoning

### Better Query Handling
- **Complex**: "What are my costs and how can I save money?" ‚Üí Both agents
- **Contextual**: "My bill seems high, any suggestions?" ‚Üí Optimization focus
- **Specific**: "Show me EC2 costs for last month" ‚Üí Cost analysis only

## Testing Strategy

The LLM-based approach can be tested with:
- Natural language variations
- Complex multi-intent queries
- Edge cases and ambiguous requests
- Real user query patterns

This represents a significant upgrade from rule-based to AI-powered routing, aligning with modern agent architecture patterns.
