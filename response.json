{"statusCode": 200, "body": {"query": "What is my S3 spend from the month of May 2025?", "response": "I notice you're asking about AWS S3 costs for May 2025, which is a future date. I can't provide costs for future months since those haven't occurred yet. Would you like me to check your S3 costs for a different time period, such as the current month-to-date or last month instead?\n\nPlease let me know which time period you'd like to check, and I'd be happy to help analyze your S3 costs.\n"}}
