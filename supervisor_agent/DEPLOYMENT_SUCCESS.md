### **Example Test Results**

**Single Agent Query** (Fast Path):
```json
{
  "routing_metrics": {
    "agents": ["cost_forecast"],
    "reasoning": "Fallback routing to cost analysis",
    "synthesis_needed": false,
    "confidence": "low",
    "routing_method": "fallback"
  }
}
```

**Strategic Query** (Synthesis Path):
```json
{
  "routing_metrics": {
    "agents": ["cost_forecast", "trusted_advisor"],
    "reasoning": "Fast route: Cost analysis and optimization query",
    "synthesis_needed": true,
    "confidence": "high",
    "routing_method": "fast_path_multi"
  }
}
```
