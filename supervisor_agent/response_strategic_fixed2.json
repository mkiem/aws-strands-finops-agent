Contact AWS Support if needed\\n   - Verify IAM permissions for Cost Explorer\\n   \\n2. **Week 2-3**: Identify and terminate completely idle EC2 instances\\n   - Potential immediate savings: ~$50-75/month\\n\\n3. **Week 3-4**: Develop right-sizing plan for underutilized instances\\n   - Document current specs vs. recommended specs\\n   - Coordinate testing windows with application owners\\n\\n### 90-Day Strategic Initiatives\\n\\n1. **Month 2**: Implement right-sizing for 50% of identified EC2 instances\\n   - Target savings: ~$125/month\\n   - Monitor performance impacts\\n\\n2. **Month 3**: Address S3 and VPC recommendations\\n   - Implement lifecycle policies for S3\\n   - Remove unused VPC resources\\n   - Begin Savings Plan evaluation\\n\\n3. **Month 3-4**: Implement EC2 auto-scaling where appropriate\\n   - Replace static over-provisioning with dynamic scaling\\n   - Implement scheduled scaling for predictable workloads\\n\\n### Long-Term Optimization Goals (6+ Months)\\n\\n1. **Establish continuous optimization workflow**\\n   - Weekly review of new recommendations\\n   - Quarterly deep-dive optimization sessions\\n   \\n2. **Implement FinOps cultural practices**\\n   - Cost-awareness training for engineering teams\\n   - Showback or chargeback models for resource consumption\\n\\n3. **Set cost efficiency KPIs**\\n   - Target 85%+ resource utilization\\n   - Commit to minimum 80% Savings Plan coverage\\n   - Aim for 95% S3 lifecycle policy coverage\\n\\nBy focusing first on the EC2 right-sizing opportunity while resolving data access issues, you can capture the known $247.97 monthly savings while preparing for more comprehensive optimization. The complete strategy will likely yield significantly higher savings once Savings Plan recommendations become accessible.\\n\", \"agent\": \"AWS-FinOps-Supervisor-Enhanced\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-06-15T01:31:01.000Z\", \"routing_metrics\": {\"agents\": [\"cost_forecast\", \"trusted_advisor\"], \"reasoning\": \"Fast route: Strategic analysis requiring cost context and optimization data\", \"synthesis_needed\": true, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"routing_method\": \"fast_path_strategic\"}}"}
