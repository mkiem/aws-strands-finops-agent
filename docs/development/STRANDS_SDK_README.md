### Content
Strands Agents SDK¶
Strands Agents is a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents.
First, install the Strands Agents SDK:
pip install strands-agents

Then create your first agent as a Python file, for this example we'll use agent.py.
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent with default settings
agent = Agent()

# Ask the agent a question
agent("Tell me about agentic AI")

Now run the agent with:
python -u agent.py

That's it!

Note: To run this example hello world agent you will need to set up credentials for our model provider and enable model access. The default model provider is Amazon Bedrock and the default model is Claude 3.7 Sonnet in the US Oregon (us-west-2) region.
For the default Amazon Bedrock model provider, see the Boto3 documentation for setting up AWS credentials. Typically for development, AWS credentials are defined in AWS_ prefixed environment variables or configured with aws configure. You will also need to enable Claude 3.7 model access in Amazon Bedrock, following the AWS documentation to enable access.
Different model providers can be configured for agents by following the quickstart guide.

Features¶
Strands Agents is lightweight and production-ready, supporting many model providers and deployment targets. 
Key features include:

Lightweight and gets out of your way: A simple agent loop that just works and is fully customizable.
Production ready: Full observability, tracing, and deployment options for running agents at scale.
Model, provider, and deployment agnostic: Strands supports many different models from many different providers.
Powerful built-in tools: Get started quickly with tools for a broad set of capabilities.
Multi-agent and autonomous agents: Apply advanced techniques to your AI systems like agent teams and agents that improve themselves over time.
Conversational, non-conversational, streaming, and non-streaming: Supports all types of agents for various workloads.
Safety and security as a priority: Run agents

AWS CDK EC2 Deployment Example¶
Introduction¶
This is a TypeScript-based CDK (Cloud Development Kit) example that demonstrates how to deploy a Python application to AWS EC2. The example deploys a weather forecaster application that runs as a service on an EC2 instance. The application provides two weather endpoints:

/weather - A standard endpoint that returns weather information based on the provided prompt
/weather-streaming - A streaming endpoint that delivers weather information in real-time as it's being generated

Prerequisites¶

AWS CLI installed and configured
Node.js (v18.x or later)
Python 3.12 or later

Project Structure¶

lib/ - Contains the CDK stack definition in TypeScript
bin/ - Contains the CDK app entry point and deployment scripts:
cdk-app.ts - Main CDK application entry point
app/ - Contains the application code:
app.py - FastAPI application code
requirements.txt - Python dependencies for the application

Setup and Deployment¶

Install dependencies:

# Install Node.js dependencies including CDK and TypeScript locally
npm install

# Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies for the local development
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# Install Python dependencies for the app distribution
pip install -r requirements.txt --python-version 3.12 --platform manylinux2014_aarch64 --target ./packaging/_dependencies --only-binary=:all:

Bootstrap your AWS environment (if not already done):

npx cdk bootstrap

Deploy the stack:

npx cdk deploy

How It Works¶
This deployment:

Creates an EC2 instance in a public subnet with a public IP
Uploads the application code to S3 as CDK assets
Uses a user data script to:
Install Python and other dependencies
Download the application code from S3
Set up the application as a systemd service using uvicorn

Tools Overview¶
http_request¶
The http_request tool enables the agent to make HTTP requests to retrieve information from the web. It supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, handles URL encoding and response parsing, and returns structured data from web sources. While this tool is used in the example to gather information from the web, understanding its implementation details is not crucial to grasp the core concept of multi-agent workflows demonstrated in this example.
Workflow Architecture¶
The Research Assistant example implements a three-agent workflow where each agent has a specific role and works with other agents to complete tasks that require multiple steps of processing:

Researcher Agent: Gathers information from web sources using http_request tool
Analyst Agent: Verifies facts and identifies key insights from research findings
Writer Agent: Creates a final report based on the analysis

Code Structure and Implementation¶
1. Agent Initialization¶
Each agent in the workflow is created with a system prompt that defines its role:
# Researcher Agent with web capabilities
researcher_agent = Agent(
    system_prompt=(
        "You are a Researcher Agent that gathers information from the web. "
        "1. Determine if the input is a research query or factual claim "
        "2. Use your research tools (http_request, retrieve) to find relevant information "

Agent Loop¶
The agent loop is a core concept in the Strands Agents SDK that enables intelligent, autonomous behavior through a cycle of reasoning, tool use, and response generation. This document explains how the agent loop works, its components, and how to effectively use it in your applications.
What is the Agent Loop?¶
The agent loop is the process by which a Strands agent processes user input, makes decisions, executes tools, and generates responses. It's designed to support complex, multi-step reasoning and actions with seamless integration of tools and language models.
flowchart LR
    A[Input & Context] --> Loop

    subgraph Loop[" "]
        direction TB

        C --> D["Tool Execution"]
        D --> B
    end

    Loop --> E[Response]
At its core, the agent loop follows these steps:

Receives user input and contextual information
Processes the input using a language model (LLM)
Decides whether to use tools to gather information or perform actions
Executes tools and receives results
Continues reasoning with the new information
Produces a final response or iterates again through the loop

This cycle may repeat multiple times within a single user interaction, allowing the agent to perform complex, multi-step reasoning and autonomous behavior.
Core Components¶
The agent loop consists of several key components working together to create a seamless experience:
Event Loop Cycle¶
The event loop cycle is the central mechanism that orchestrates the flow of information. It's implemented in the event_loop_cycle function, which:

Processes messages with the language model
Handles tool execution requests
Manages conversation state
Handles errors and retries with exponential backoff
Collects metrics and traces for observability

### Content
Context Management¶
In the Strands Agents SDK, context refers to the conversation history that provides the foundation for the agent's understanding and reasoning. This includes:

User messages
Agent responses
Tool usage and results
System prompts

As conversations grow, managing this context becomes increasingly important for several reasons:

Token Limits: Language models have fixed context windows (maximum tokens they can process)
Performance: Larger contexts require more processing time and resources
Relevance: Older messages may become less relevant to the current conversation
Coherence: Maintaining logical flow and preserving important information

Conversation Managers¶
The SDK provides a flexible system for context management through the ConversationManager interface. This allows you to implement different strategies for managing conversation history. There are two key methods to implement:

apply_management: This method is called after each event loop cycle completes to manage the conversation history. It's responsible for applying your management strategy to the messages array, which may have been modified with tool results and assistant responses. The agent runs this method automatically after processing each user input and generating a response.

reduce_context: This method is called when the model's context window is exceeded (typically due to token limits). It implements the specific strategy for reducing the window size when necessary. The agent calls this method when it encounters a context window overflow exception, giving your implementation a chance to trim the conversation history before retrying.

To manage conversations, you can either leverage one of Strands's provided managers or build your own manager that matches your requirements.
NullConversationManager¶
The NullConversationManager is a simple implementation that does not modify the conversation history. It's useful for:

Short conversations that won't exceed context limits

### Content
Sessions & State¶
This document explains how Strands agents maintain conversation context, handle state management, and support persistent sessions across interactions.
Strands agents maintain state in several forms:

Conversation History: The sequence of messages between the user and the agent
Tool State: Information about tool executions and results
Request State: Contextual information maintained within a single request

Understanding how state works in Strands is essential for building agents that can maintain context across multi-turn interactions and workflows.
Conversation History¶
The primary form of state in a Strands agent is the conversation history, directly accessible through the agent.messages property:
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent
agent = Agent()

# Send a message and get a response
agent("Hello!")

# Access the conversation history
print(agent.messages)  # Shows all messages exchanged so far

The agent.messages list contains all user and assistant messages, including tool calls and tool results. This is the primary way to inspect what's happening in your agent's conversation.
You can initialize an agent with existing messages to continue a conversation or pre-fill your Agent's context with information:
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent with initial messages
agent = Agent(messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": [{"text": "Hello, my name is Strands!"}]},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"text": "Hi there! How can I help you today?"}]}
])

# Continue the conversation
agent("What's my name?")

Conversation history is automatically:

Maintained between calls to the agent
Passed to the model during each inference
Used for tool execution context
Managed to prevent context window overflow

Conversation Manager¶
Strands uses a conversation manager to handle conversation history effectively. The default is the SlidingWindowConversationManager, which keeps recent messages and removes older ones when needed:
from strands impor

#### Example 2

agent("Hello!")

```

#### Example 3

Amazon Bedrock¶
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies through a unified API. Strands provides native support for Amazon Bedrock, allowing you to use these powerful models in your agents with minimal configuration.
The BedrockModel class in Strands enables seamless integration with Amazon Bedrock's API, supporting:

Text generation
Multi-Modal understanding (Image, Document, etc.)
Tool/function calling
Guardrail configurations
System Prompt, Tool, and/or Message caching

Getting Started¶
Prerequisites¶

AWS Account: You need an AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock
Model Access: Request access to your desired models in the Amazon Bedrock console
AWS Credentials: Configure AWS credentials with appropriate permissions

Required IAM Permissions¶
To use Amazon Bedrock with Strands, your IAM user or role needs the following permissions:

bedrock-runtime:InvokeModelWithResponseStream (for streaming mode)
bedrock-runtime:InvokeModel (for non-streaming mode)

Here's a sample IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock-runtime:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
                "bedrock-runtime:InvokeModel"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

For production environments, it's recommended to scope down the Resource to specific model ARNs.
Requesting Access to Bedrock Models¶
Before you can use a model in Amazon Bedrock, you need to request access to it:

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Bedrock console
In the navigation pane, choose Model access
Choose Manage model access
Select the checkbox next to each model you want to access
Choose Request model access
Review the terms and conditions, then select I accept these terms
Choose Request model access

The model access request is typically processed

Creating a Custom Model Provider¶
Strands Agents SDK provides an extensible interface for implementing custom model providers, allowing organizations to integrate their own LLM services while keeping implementation details private to their codebase.
Model Provider Architecture¶
Strands Agents uses an abstract Model class that defines the standard interface all model providers must implement:

### Content
Agents as Tools with Strands Agents SDK¶
The Concept: Agents as Tools¶
"Agents as Tools" is an architectural pattern in AI systems where specialized AI agents are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by other agents. This creates a hierarchical structure where:

A primary "orchestrator" agent handles user interaction and determines which specialized agent to call
Specialized "tool agents" perform domain-specific tasks when called by the orchestrator

This approach mimics human team dynamics, where a manager coordinates specialists, each bringing unique expertise to solve complex problems. Rather than a single agent trying to handle everything, tasks are delegated to the most appropriate specialized agent.
Key Benefits and Core Principles¶
The "Agents as Tools" pattern offers several advantages:

Separation of concerns: Each agent has a focused area of responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain
Hierarchical delegation: The orchestrator decides which specialist to invoke, creating a clear chain of command
Modular architecture: Specialists can be added, removed, or modified independently without affecting the entire system
Improved performance: Each agent can have tailored system prompts and tools optimized for its specific task

Strands Agents SDK Best Practices for Agent Tools¶
When implementing the "Agents as Tools" pattern with Strands Agents SDK:

Clear tool documentation: Write descriptive docstrings that explain the agent's expertise
Focused system prompts: Keep each specialized agent tightly focused on its domain

Async Iterators for Streaming¶
Strands Agents SDK provides support for asynchronous iterators through the stream_async method, enabling real-time streaming of agent responses in asynchronous environments like web servers, APIs, and other async applications.

Note: If you want to use callbacks instead of async iterators, take a look at the callback handlers documentation. Async iterators are ideal for asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI, aiohttp, or Django Channels. For these environments, Strands Agents SDK offers the stream_async method which returns an asynchronous iterator.

Basic Usage¶
import asyncio
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

# Initialize our agent without a callback handler
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator],
    callback_handler=None
)

# Async function that iterators over streamed agent events
async def process_streaming_response():
    agent_stream = agent.stream_async("Calculate 2+2")
    async for event in agent_stream:
        print(event)

# Run the agent
asyncio.run(process_streaming_response())

Event Types¶
The async iterator yields the same event types as callback handlers, including:
Text Generation Events¶

data: Text chunk from the model's output
complete: Boolean indicating if this is the final chunk
delta: Raw delta content from the model

Tool Events¶

current_tool_use: Information about the current tool being used, including:
toolUseId: Unique ID for this tool use
name: Name of the tool
input: Tool input parameters (accumulated as streaming occurs)

Lifecycle Events¶

init_event_loop: True when the event loop is initializing
start_event_loop: True when the event loop is starting
start: True when a new cycle starts
message: Present when a new message is created
event: Raw event from the model stream
force_stop: True if the event loop was forced to stop
force_stop_reason: Reason for forced stop

Reasoning Events¶

reasoning: True for reasoning events
reasoningText: Text from reasoning process

### Content
Callback Handlers¶
Callback handlers are a powerful feature of the Strands Agents SDK that allow you to intercept and process events as they happen during agent execution. This enables real-time monitoring, custom output formatting, and integration with external systems.
Callback handlers receive events in real-time as they occur during an agent's lifecycle:

Text generation from the model
Tool selection and execution
Reasoning process
Errors and completions

Note: For asynchronous applications such as web servers, Strands Agents also provides async iterators as an alternative to callback-based callback handlers.

Basic Usage¶
The simplest way to use a callback handler is to pass a callback function to your agent:
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

def custom_callback_handler(**kwargs):
    # Process stream data
    if "data" in kwargs:
        print(f"MODEL OUTPUT: {kwargs['data']}")
    elif "current_tool_use" in kwargs and kwargs["current_tool_use"].get("name"):
        print(f"\nUSING TOOL: {kwargs['current_tool_use']['name']}")

# Create an agent with custom callback handler
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator],
    callback_handler=custom_callback_handler
)

agent("Calculate 2+2")

Callback Handler Events¶
Callback handlers receive the same event types as async iterators, as keyword arguments:
Text Generation Events¶

data: Text chunk from the model's output
complete: Boolean indicating if this is the final chunk
delta: Raw delta content from the model

Tool Events¶

current_tool_use: Information about the current tool being used, including:
toolUseId: Unique ID for this tool use
name: Name of the tool
input: Tool input parameters (accumulated as streaming occurs)

Lifecycle Events¶

init_event_loop: True when the event loop is initializing
start_event_loop: True when the event loop is starting
start: True when a new cycle starts
message: Present when a new message is created
event: Raw event from the model stream
force_stop: True

Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools¶
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Strands Agents integrates with MCP to extend agent capabilities through external tools and services.
MCP enables communication between agents and MCP servers that provide additional tools. Strands includes built-in support for connecting to MCP servers and using their tools.
When working with MCP tools in Strands, all agent operations must be performed within the MCP client's context manager (using a with statement). 
This requirement ensures that the MCP session remains active and connected while the agent is using the tools. 
If you attempt to use an agent or its MCP tools outside of this context, you'll encounter errors because the MCP session will have closed.
MCP Server Connection Options¶
Strands provides several ways to connect to MCP servers:
1. Standard I/O (stdio)¶
For command-line tools and local processes that implement the MCP protocol:
from mcp import stdio_client, StdioServerParameters
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools.mcp import MCPClient

# Connect to an MCP server using stdio transport
# Note: uvx command syntax differs by platform

# For macOS/Linux:
stdio_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(
    StdioServerParameters(
        command="uvx", 
        args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"]
    )
))

# For Windows:
stdio_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(
    StdioServerParameters(
        command="uvx", 
        args=[
            "--from", 
            "awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest", 
            "awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server.exe"
        ]
    )
))

# Create an agent with MCP tools
with stdio_mcp_client:
    # Get the tools from the MCP server
    tools = stdio_mcp_client.list_tools_sync()

    # Create an agent with these tools
    agent = Agent(tools=tools)
    agent("What is AWS Lambda?")

Python Tools¶
There are two approaches to defining python-based tools in Strands:

Python functions with the @tool decorator: Transform regular Python functions into tools by adding a simple decorator. This approach leverages Python's docstrings and type hints to automatically generate tool specifications.

Python modules following a specific format: Define tools by creating Python modules that contain a tool specification and a matching function. This approach gives you more control over the tool's definition and is useful for dependency-free implementations of tools.

Python Tool Decorators¶
The @tool decorator provides a straightforward way to transform regular Python functions into tools that agents can use.
Basic Example¶
Here's a simple example of a function decorated as a tool:
from strands import tool

@tool
def weather_forecast(city: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for a city.

    Args:
        city: The name of the city
        days: Number of days for the forecast
    """
    return f"Weather forecast for {city} for the next {days} days..."

The decorator extracts information from your function's docstring to create the tool specification. The first paragraph becomes the tool's description, and the "Args" section provides parameter descriptions. These are combined with the function's type hints to create a complete tool specification.
Loading Function-Decorated tools¶
To use function-based tool, simply pass the function to the agent:
agent = Agent(
    tools=[weather_forecast]
)

Overriding Tool Name and Description¶
You can also optionally override the tool name or description by providing them as arguments to the decorator:
@tool(name="get_weather", description="Retrieves weather forecast for a specified location")
def weather_forecast(city: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Implementation function for weather forecasting.

    Args:
        city: The name of the city
        days: Number of days for the forecast
    """
    #

### Content
Tools Overview¶
Tools are the primary mechanism for extending agent capabilities, enabling them to perform actions beyond simple text generation. Tools allow agents to interact with external systems, access data, and manipulate their environment.
Strands offers built-in example tools to get started quickly experimenting with agents and tools during development. For more information, see Example Built-in Tools.
Adding Tools to Agents¶
Tools are passed to agents during initialization or at runtime, making them available for use throughout the agent's lifecycle. Once loaded, the agent can use these tools in response to user requests:
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator, file_read, shell

# Add tools to our agent
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator, file_read, shell]
)

# Agent will automatically determine when to use the calculator tool
agent("What is 42 ^ 9")

print("\n\n")  # Print new lines

# Agent will use the shell and file reader tool when appropriate
agent("Show me the contents of a single file in this directory")

We can see which tools are loaded in our agent in agent.tool_names, along with a JSON representation of the tools in agent.tool_config that also includes the tool descriptions and input parameters:
print(agent.tool_names)

print(agent.tool_config)

Tools can also be loaded by passing a file path to our agents during initialization:
agent = Agent(tools=["/path/to/my_tool.py"])

Auto-loading and reloading tools¶
Tools placed in your current working directory ./tools/ can be automatically loaded at agent initialization, and automatically reloaded when modified. This can be really useful when developing and debugging tools: simply modify the tool code and any agents using that tool will reload it to use the latest modifications!
Automatic loading and reloading of tools in the ./tools/ directory is enabled by default with the load_tools_from_directory=True parameter passed to Agent during initialization. To disable this behavio

Deploying Strands Agents SDK Agents to Amazon EC2¶
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, making it a flexible option for deploying Strands Agents SDK agents. This deployment approach gives you full control over the underlying infrastructure while maintaining the ability to scale as needed.
If you're not familiar with the AWS CDK, check out the official documentation.
This guide discusses EC2 integration at a high level - for a complete example project deploying to EC2, check out the deploy_to_ec2 sample project on GitHub.
Creating Your Agent in Python¶
The core of your EC2 deployment is a FastAPI application that hosts your Strands Agents SDK agent. This Python application initializes your agent and processes incoming HTTP requests.
The FastAPI application follows these steps:

Define endpoints for agent interactions
Create a Strands Agents SDK agent with the specified system prompt and tools
Process incoming requests through the agent
Return the response back to the client

Here's an example of a weather forecasting agent application (app.py):
app = FastAPI(title="Weather API")

# Define a weather-focused system prompt
WEATHER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a weather assistant with HTTP capabilities. You can:

1. Make HTTP requests to the National Weather Service API
2. Process and display weather forecast data
3. Provide weather information for locations in the United States

When retrieving weather information:
1. First get the coordinates or grid information using https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude} or https://api.weather.gov/points/{zipcode}
2. Then use the returned forecast URL to get the actual forecast

When displaying responses:
- Format weather data in a human-readable way

Deploying Strands Agents SDK Agents to AWS Fargate¶
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon ECS and EKS. It allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. This makes it an excellent choice for deploying Strands Agents SDK agents as containerized applications with high availability and scalability.
If you're not familiar with the AWS CDK, check out the official documentation.
This guide discusses Fargate integration at a high level - for a complete example project deploying to Fargate, check out the deploy_to_fargate sample project on GitHub.
Creating Your Agent in Python¶
The core of your Fargate deployment is a containerized FastAPI application that hosts your Strands Agents SDK agent. This Python application initializes your agent and processes incoming HTTP requests.
The FastAPI application follows these steps:

Define endpoints for agent interactions
Create a Strands Agents SDK agent with the specified system prompt and tools
Process incoming requests through the agent
Return the response back to the client

Here's an example of a weather forecasting agent application (app.py):
app = FastAPI(title="Weather API")

# Define a weather-focused system prompt
WEATHER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a weather assistant with HTTP capabilities. You can:

1. Make HTTP requests to the National Weather Service API
2. Process and display weather forecast data
3. Provide weather information for locations in the United States

When retrieving weather information:
1. First get the coordinates or grid information using https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude} or https://api.weather.gov/points/{zipcode}
2. Then use the returned forecast URL to get the actual forecast

When displaying responses:
- Format weather data in a human-readable way
- Highlight important information like temperature, precipitation, and alerts
- Handle errors appropriately
- Don't ask follow-up questions

Operating Agents in Production¶
This guide provides best practices for deploying Strands agents in production environments, focusing on security, stability, and performance optimization.
Production Configuration¶
When transitioning from development to production, it's essential to configure your agents for optimal performance, security, and reliability. The following sections outline key considerations and recommended settings.
Agent Initialization¶
For production deployments, initialize your agents with explicit configurations tailored to your production requirements rather than relying on defaults.
Model configuration¶
For example, passing in models with specific configuration properties:
agent_model = BedrockModel(
    model_id="us.amazon.nova-premier-v1:0",
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=2000,
    top_p=0.8,
)

agent = Agent(model=agent_model)

See:

Bedrock Model Usage
Ollama Model Usage

Tool Management¶
In production environments, it's critical to control which tools are available to your agent. You should:

Explicitly Specify Tools: Always provide an explicit list of tools rather than loading all available tools
Disable Automatic Tool Loading: For stability in production, disable automatic loading and reloading of tools
Audit Tool Usage: Regularly review which tools are being used and remove any that aren't necessary for your use case

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    # Explicitly specify tools
    tools=[weather_research, weather_analysis, summarizer],
    # Disable automatic tool loading in production
    load_tools_from_directory=False,
)

See Adding Tools to Agents and Auto reloading tools for more information.
Security Considerations¶
For production environments:

Tool Permissions: Review and restrict the permissions of each tool to follow the principle of least privilege
Input Validation: Always validate user inputs before passing to Strands Agents
Output Sanitization: Sanitize outputs for sensitive information. Consider leveraging guardrails as an aut

### Content
Evaluation¶
This guide covers approaches to evaluating agents. Effective evaluation is essential for measuring agent performance, tracking improvements, and ensuring your agents meet quality standards.
When building AI agents, evaluating their performance is crucial during this process. It's important to consider various qualitative and quantitative factors, including response quality, task completion, success, and inaccuracies or hallucinations. In evaluations, it's also important to consider comparing different agent configurations to optimize for specific desired outcomes. Given the dynamic and non-deterministic nature of LLMs, it's also important to have rigorous and frequent evaluations to ensure a consistent baseline for tracking improvements or regressions. 
Creating Test Cases¶
Basic Test Case Structure¶
[
  {
    "id": "knowledge-1",
    "query": "What is the capital of France?",
    "expected": "The capital of France is Paris.",
    "category": "knowledge"
  },
  {
    "id": "calculation-1",
    "query": "Calculate the total cost of 5 items at $12.99 each with 8% tax.",
    "expected": "The total cost would be $70.15.",
    "category": "calculation"
  }
]

Test Case Categories¶
When developing your test cases, consider building a diverse suite that spans multiple categories. 
Some common categories to consider include:
1. Knowledge Retrieval - Facts, definitions, explanations
2. Reasoning - Logic problems, deductions, inferences
3. Tool Usage - Tasks requiring specific tool selection
4. Conversation - Multi-turn interactions
5. Edge Cases - Unusual or boundary scenarios
6. Safety - Handling of sensitive topics
Metrics to Consider¶
Evaluating agent performance requires tracking multiple dimensions of quality; consider tracking these metrics in addition to any domain-specific metrics for your industry or use case:

Accuracy - Factual correctness of responses
Task Completion - Whether the agent successfully completed the tasks
Tool Selection - Appropriateness

### Content
Logging¶
Strands SDK uses Python's standard logging module to provide visibility into its operations. This document explains how logging is implemented in the SDK and how you can configure it for your needs.
The Strands Agents SDK implements a straightforward logging approach:

Module-level Loggers: Each module in the SDK creates its own logger using logging.getLogger(__name__), following Python best practices for hierarchical logging.

Root Logger: All loggers in the SDK are children of the "strands" root logger, making it easy to configure logging for the entire SDK.

Default Behavior: By default, the SDK doesn't configure any handlers or log levels, allowing you to integrate it with your application's logging configuration.

Configuring Logging¶
To enable logging for the Strands Agents SDK, you can configure the "strands" logger:
import logging

# Configure the root strands logger
logging.getLogger("strands").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Add a handler to see the logs
logging.basicConfig(
    format="%(levelname)s | %(name)s | %(message)s", 
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
)

Log Levels¶
The Strands Agents SDK uses standard Python log levels, with specific usage patterns:

DEBUG: Extensively used throughout the SDK for detailed operational information, particularly for tool registration, discovery, configuration, and execution flows. This level provides visibility into the internal workings of the SDK, including tool registry operations, event loop processing, and model interactions.

INFO: Not currently used in the Strands Agents SDK. The SDK jumps from DEBUG (for detailed operational information) directly to WARNING (for potential issues).

WARNING: Commonly used to indicate potential issues that don't prevent operation, such as tool validation failures, specification validation errors, and context window overflow conditions. These logs highlight situations that might require attention but don't cause immediate failures.

ERROR: Used to report significant p

### Content
Metrics¶
Metrics are essential for understanding agent performance, optimizing behavior, and monitoring resource usage. The Strands Agents SDK provides comprehensive metrics tracking capabilities that give you visibility into how your agents operate.
Overview¶
The Strands Agents SDK automatically tracks key metrics during agent execution:

Token usage: Input tokens, output tokens, and total tokens consumed
Performance metrics: Latency and execution time measurements
Tool usage: Call counts, success rates, and execution times for each tool
Event loop cycles: Number of reasoning cycles and their durations

All these metrics are accessible through the AgentResult object that's returned whenever you invoke an agent:
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

# Create an agent with tools
agent = Agent(tools=[calculator])

# Invoke the agent with a prompt and get an AgentResult
result = agent("What is the square root of 144?")

# Access metrics through the AgentResult
print(f"Total tokens: {result.metrics.accumulated_usage['totalTokens']}")
print(f"Execution time: {sum(result.metrics.cycle_durations):.2f} seconds")
print(f"Tools used: {list(result.metrics.tool_metrics.keys())}")

The metrics attribute of AgentResult (an instance of EventLoopMetrics provides comprehensive performance metric data about the agent's execution, while other attributes like stop_reason, message, and state provide context about the agent's response. This document explains the metrics available in the agent's response and how to interpret them.
EventLoopMetrics¶
The EventLoopMetrics class aggregates metrics across the entire event loop execution cycle, providing a complete picture of your agent's performance.
Key Attributes¶

### Content
Observability¶
In the Strands Agents SDK, observability refers to the ability to measure system behavior and performance. Observability is the combination of instrumentation, data collection, and analysis techniques that provide insights into an agent's behavior and performance. It enables Strands Agents developers to effectively build, debug and maintain agents to better serve their unique customer needs and reliably complete their tasks. This guide provides background on what type of data (or "Primitives") makes up observability as well as best practices for implementing agent observability with the Strands Agents SDK. 
Embedded in Strands Agents¶
All observability APIs are embedded directly within the Strands Agents SDK. 
While this document provides high-level information about observability, look to the following specific documents on how to instrument these primitives in your system:

Metrics
Traces
Logs
Evaluation

Telemetry Primitives¶
Building observable agents starts with monitoring the right telemetry. While we leverage the same fundamental building blocks as traditional software — traces, metrics, and logs — their application to agents requires special consideration. We need to capture not only standard application telemetry but also AI-specific signals like model interactions, reasoning steps, and tool usage.
Traces¶
A trace represents an end-to-end request to your application. Traces consist of spans which represent the intermediate steps the application took to generate a response. Agent traces typically contain spans which represent model and tool invocations. Spans are enriched by context associated with the step they are tracking. For example:

A model invocation span may include:
System prompt
Model parameters (e.g. temperature, top_p, top_k, max_tokens)
Input and output message list
Input and output token usage

A tool invocation span may include the tool input and output

Traces provide deep insight into how an agent or workflow arrived at its f

Traces¶
Tracing is a fundamental component of the Strands SDK's observability framework, providing detailed insights into your agent's execution. Using the OpenTelemetry standard, Strands traces capture the complete journey of a request through your agent, including LLM interactions, retrievers, tool usage, and event loop processing.
Understanding Traces in Strands¶
Traces in Strands provide a hierarchical view of your agent's execution, allowing you to:

Track the entire agent lifecycle: From initial prompt to final response
Monitor individual LLM calls: Examine prompts, completions, and token usage
Analyze tool execution: Understand which tools were called, with what parameters, and their results
Measure performance: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
Debug complex workflows: Follow the exact path of execution through multiple cycles

Each trace consists of multiple spans that represent different operations in your agent's execution flow:

Quickstart
This quickstart guide shows you how to create your first basic Strands agent, add built-in and custom tools to your agent, use different model providers, emit debug logs, and run the agent locally.
After completing this guide you can integrate your agent with a web server, implement concepts like multi-agent, evaluate and improve your agent, along with deploying to production and running at scale.
Install the SDK¶
First, ensure that you have Python 3.10+ installed.
We'll create a virtual environment to install the Strands Agents SDK and its dependencies in to.
python -m venv .venv

And activate the virtual environment:

macOS / Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
Windows (CMD): .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Windows (PowerShell): .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Next we'll install the strands-agents SDK package:
pip install strands-agents

The Strands Agents SDK additionally offers the strands-agents-tools (GitHub) and strands-agents-builder (GitHub) packages for development. The strands-agents-tools package provides many example tools that give your agents powerful abilities. The strands-agents-builder package provides an agent that helps you to build your own Strands agents and tools.
Let's install those development packages too:
pip install strands-agents-tools strands-agents-builder

Configuring Credentials¶
Strands supports many different model providers. By default, agents use the Amazon Bedrock model provider with the Claude 3.7 model.
To use the examples in this guide, you'll need to configure your environment with AWS credentials that have permissions to invoke the Claude 3.7 model. You can set up your credentials in several ways:

Environment variables: Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and optionally AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
AWS credentials file: Configure credentials using aws configure CLI command
IAM roles: If running on AWS services like EC2, ECS, or Lambda, use IAM roles

Make sure your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to access Ama

Guardrails¶
Strands Agents SDK provides seamless integration with guardrails, enabling you to implement content filtering, topic blocking, PII protection, and other safety measures in your AI applications.
What Are Guardrails?¶
Guardrails are safety mechanisms that help control AI system behavior by defining boundaries for content generation and interaction. They act as protective layers that:

Filter harmful or inappropriate content - Block toxicity, profanity, hate speech, etc.
Protect sensitive information - Detect and redact PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
Enforce topic boundaries - Prevent responses on custom disallowed topics outside of the domain of an AI agent, allowing AI systems to be tailored for specific use cases or audiences
Ensure response quality - Maintain adherence to guidelines and policies
Enable compliance - Help meet regulatory requirements for AI systems
Enforce trust - Build user confidence by delivering appropriate, reliable responses
Manage Risk - Reduce legal and reputational risks associated with AI deployment

Guardrails in Different Model Providers¶
Strands Agents SDK allows integration with different model providers, which implement guardrails differently.
Amazon Bedrock¶
Amazon Bedrock provides a built-in guardrails framework that integrates directly with Strands Agents SDK. If a guardrail is triggered, the Strands Agents SDK will automatically overwrite the user's input in the conversation history. This is done so that follow-up questions are not also blocked by the same questions. This can be configured with the guardrail_redact_input boolean, and the guardrail_redact_input_message string to change the overwrite message. Additionally, the same functionality is built for the model's output, but this is disabled by default. You can enable this with the guardrail_redact_output boolean, and change the overwrite message with the guardrail_redact_output_message string. Below is an example of how to leverage Bedrock guardrails in

### Content
Prompt Engineering¶
Effective prompt engineering is crucial not only for maximizing Strands Agents' capabilities but also for securing against LLM-based threats. This guide outlines key techniques for creating secure prompts that enhance reliability, specificity, and performance, while protecting against common attack vectors. It's always recommended to systematically test prompts across varied inputs, comparing variations to identify potential vulnerabilities. Security testing should also include adversarial examples to verify prompt robustness against potential attacks.
Core Principles and Techniques¶
1. Clarity and Specificity¶
Guidance:

Prevent prompt confusion attacks by establishing clear boundaries
State tasks, formats, and expectations explicitly
Reduce ambiguity with clear instructions
Use examples to demonstrate desired outputs
Break complex tasks into discrete steps
Limit the attack surface by constraining responses

Implementation:
# Example of security-focused task definition
agent = Agent(
    system_prompt="""You are an API documentation specialist. When documenting code:
    1. Identify function name, parameters, and return type
    2. Create a concise description of the function's purpose
    3. Describe each parameter and return value
    4. Format using Markdown with proper code blocks
    5. Include a usage example

    SECURITY CONSTRAINTS:
    - Never generate actual authentication credentials
    - Do not suggest vulnerable code practices (SQL injection, XSS)
    - Always recommend input validation
    - Flag any security-sensitive parameters in documentation"""
)

2. Defend Against Prompt Injection with Structured Input¶
Guidance:

Use clear section delimiters to separate user input from instructions
Apply consistent markup patterns to distinguish system instructions
Implement defensive parsing of outputs
Create recognizable patterns that reveal manipulation attempts

Implementation:

Responsible AI¶
Strands Agents SDK provides powerful capabilities for building AI agents with access to tools and external resources. With this power comes the responsibility to ensure your AI applications are developed and deployed in an ethical, safe, and beneficial manner. This guide outlines best practices for responsible AI usage with the Strands Agents SDK. Please also reference our Prompt Engineering page for guidance on how to effectively create agents that align with responsible AI usage, and Guardrails page for how to add mechanisms to ensure safety and security.
Core Principles¶
Transparency¶
Be transparent about AI system capabilities and limitations:

Clearly identify when users are interacting with an AI system
Communicate the capabilities and limitations of your agent
Do not misrepresent what your AI can or cannot do
Be forthright about the probabilistic nature of AI outputs and their limitations
Disclose when systems may produce inaccurate or inappropriate content

Human Oversight and Control¶
Maintain appropriate human oversight and control over AI systems:

Implement approval workflows for sensitive operations
Design tools with appropriate permission levels
Log and review tool usage patterns
Ensure human review for consequential decisions affecting fundamental rights, health, safety, or access to critical resources
Never implement lethal weapon functions without human authorization and control

Data Privacy and Security¶
Respect user privacy and maintain data security:

Minimize data collection to what is necessary
Implement proper data encryption and security measures
Build tools with privacy-preserving defaults
Comply with relevant data protection regulations
Strictly prohibit violations of privacy rights, including unlawful tracking, monitoring, or identification
Never create, store, or distribute unauthorized impersonations or non-consensual imagery

Fairness and Bias Mitigation¶
Identify, prevent, and mitigate unfair bias in AI systems:

Use d
