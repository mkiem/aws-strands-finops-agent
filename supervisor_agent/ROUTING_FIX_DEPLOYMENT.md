# Routing Fix Deployment Summary

## Issue Identified
The supervisor agent was returning `'response': 'None'` because the LLM router was returning `["both"]` but the routing logic expected either:
- Single agent: `["cost_forecast"]` or `["trusted_advisor"]`  
- Both agents: `["cost_forecast", "trusted_advisor"]`

## Root Cause
The LLM was correctly identifying comprehensive queries and returning `{"agents": ["both"]}`, but the supervisor agent logic didn't handle the `"both"` value properly.

## Solution Implemented

### Code Fix Applied
Added logic to handle `"both"` routing decision:

```python
# Handle "both" routing decision by converting to explicit agent list
if "both" in agents_to_invoke:
    agents_to_invoke = ["cost_forecast", "trusted_advisor"]
```

### Deployment Status
✅ **Container Built**: Updated Docker image with routing fix
✅ **ECR Push**: Image pushed to 837882009522.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-finops-agent:latest
✅ **Lambda Updated**: Function code updated successfully
✅ **Status**: Deployment completed successfully

## Expected Behavior Now

### Query Flow
1. User Query: "What are my current AWS costs and optimization opportunities?"
2. LLM Router: Returns `{"agents": ["both"], "reasoning": "..."}`
3. Supervisor Agent: Converts `["both"]` → `["cost_forecast", "trusted_advisor"]`
4. Invokes both downstream agents
5. Combines responses into comprehensive analysis

### Test Results Expected
- ✅ LLM routing working (already confirmed)
- ✅ Agent invocation should now work
- ✅ Response should contain actual agent outputs instead of 'None'

## Files Modified
- `lambda_handler.py` - Added "both" handling logic
- Container rebuilt and deployed

## Ready for Testing
The supervisor agent should now properly:
- Route queries using LLM intelligence
- Handle "both" routing decisions correctly
- Invoke downstream agents as expected
- Return comprehensive analysis instead of 'None'

The fix addresses the specific issue where the routing decision was correct but not properly handled by the supervisor logic.
