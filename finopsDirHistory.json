    "Great! I've successfully helped you build a Lambda package for your FinOps agent based on the Strands SDK. Here's a summary of what we've done:\n\n1. Created the necessary files for your agent:\n   - `lambda_function.py`: The Lambda handler that processes incoming requests and uses the Strands agent\n   - Updated the agent configuration with basic tools (calculator, current_time, python_repl)\n\n2. Created deployment scripts:\n   - `build_lambda_package.sh`: A script to build the Lambda deployment package\n   - `cloudformation.yaml`: A CloudFormation template for deploying the Lambda function with API Gateway\n\n3. Built the Lambda package:\n   - The script created a `finops_agent_lambda.zip` file containing all the necessary dependencies\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo deploy your FinOps agent to AWS:\n\n1. Upload the Lambda package to an S3 bucket:\n```bash\naws s3 cp finops_agent_lambda.zip s3://your-bucket-name/finops_agent_lambda.zip\n```\n\n2. Deploy using CloudFormation:\n```bash\naws cloudformation deploy \\\n  --template-file cloudformation.yaml \\\n  --stack-name finops-agent \\\n  --parameter-overrides \\\n    LambdaS3Bucket=your-bucket-name \\\n    LambdaS3Key=finops_agent_lambda.zip \\\n    LambdaTimeout=30 \\\n    LambdaMemorySize=256 \\\n  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM\n```\n\n## Customizing Your Agent\n\nTo enhance your FinOps agent's capabilities:\n\n1. Add AWS cost analysis tools to the agent in `lambda_function.py`\n2. Update the IAM permissions in `cloudformation.yaml` to allow access to Cost Explorer and other FinOps-related services\n3. Implement custom tools using the Strands SDK to handle specific FinOps queries\n\nThe Lambda function is currently set up to receive a query parameter and return the agent's response. You can test it using the API Gateway endpoint or by directly invoking the Lambda function once deployed.\n[Tool uses: none]",

    "I've reviewed and created the `agent06012025.yaml` CloudFormation template with the necessary IAM permissions for Amazon Bedrock and Cost Explorer. Here's what I've included:\n\n## IAM Role Permissions\n\nThe CloudFormation template now includes:\n\n1. **Amazon Bedrock Permissions**:\n   - `bedrock:InvokeModel` - Allows the Lambda function to call Bedrock models\n   - `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` - Allows streaming responses from Bedrock models\n\n2. **AWS Cost Explorer Permissions** (for FinOps functionality):\n   - `ce:GetCostAndUsage` - Retrieve cost and usage data\n   - `ce:GetCostForecast` - Get cost forecasts\n   - `ce:GetReservationUtilization` - Check reservation utilization\n   - `ce:GetSavingsPlansUtilization` - Check Savings Plans utilization\n   - `ce:GetDimensionValues` - Get dimension values for filtering\n   - `ce:GetTags` - Get cost allocation tags\n\n3. **Basic Lambda Execution Role**:\n   - Includes the managed policy for basic Lambda execution (CloudWatch Logs access)\n\n## S3 Bucket Configuration\n\nThe template is configured to use the specified S3 bucket:\n```yaml\nCode:\n  S3Bucket: finops-deployment-packages-062025\n  S3Key: !Ref LambdaS3Key\n```\n\n## Enhanced Lambda Function\n\nI've also updated the Lambda function code to include a custom FinOps tool that uses the Cost Explorer API to retrieve AWS cost data. This demonstrates how the IAM permissions will be used.\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nTo deploy your FinOps agent:\n\n1. Build the Lambda package:\n```bash\n./build_lambda_package.sh\n```\n\n2. Upload to the specified S3 bucket:\n```bash\naws s3 cp finops_agent_lambda.zip s3://finops-deployment-packages-062025/finops_agent_lambda.zip\n```\n\n3. Deploy with CloudFormation:\n```bash\naws cloudformation deploy \\\n  --template-file agent06012025.yaml \\\n  --stack-name finops-agent \\\n  --parameter-overrides \\\n    LambdaS3Key=finops_agent_lambda.zip \\\n  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM\n```\n\nThe template is now properly configured to create a Lambda function with the necessary permissions for Amazon Bedrock model invocation and Cost Explorer access, with the deployment package stored in the specified S3 bucket.\n[Tool uses: none]",

The problem was that you were trying to set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in your Lambda function, but this is a reserved environment variable that AWS Lambda doesn't allow you to modify directly.\n\nHere are the changes I made:\n\n## 1. Fixed the CloudFormation Template\n\nIn `agent06012025.yaml`, I changed:\n```yaml\nEnvironment:\n  Variables:\n    AWS_REGION: !Ref AWS::Region  # This was causing the error\n    LOG_LEVEL: INFO\n```\n\nTo:\n```yaml\nEnvironment:\n  Variables:\n    REGION: !Ref AWS::Region  # Changed to a non-reserved name\n    LOG_LEVEL: INFO\n```\n\n## 2. Updated the Lambda Function Code\n\nIn `lambda_function.py`, I made these changes:\n\n1. Removed the direct setting of `os.environ['AWS_REGION']`\n2. Added code to read the region from the environment variable:\n   ```python\n   # Get region from environment variable or use default\n   region = os.environ.get('REGION', 'us-east-1')\n   ```\n3. Updated the Agent initialization to use this region:\n   ```python\n   agent = Agent(\n       tools=[calculator, current_time, python_repl, get_aws_cost_summary],\n       region_name=region  # Pass the region to the Agent constructor\n   )\n   ```\n4. Updated the Cost Explorer client to use the region:\n   ```python\n   ce = boto3.client('ce', region_name=region)\n   ```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nNow you should be able to deploy without errors:\n\n1. Rebuild the Lambda package:\n```bash\ncd my_agent\n./build_lambda_package.sh\n```\n\n2. Upload to S3:\n```bash\naws s3 cp my_agent/finops_agent_lambda.zip s3://finops-deployment-packages-062025/finops_agent_lambda.zip\n```\n\n3. Deploy with CloudFormation:\n```bash\naws cloudformation deploy \\\n  --template-file my_agent/agent06012025.yaml \\\n  --stack-name finops-agent \\\n  --parameter-overrides \\\n    LambdaS3Key=finops_agent_lambda.zip \\\n  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM\n```\n\nThis change avoids using the reserved `AWS_REGION` environment variable while still allowing your Lambda function to know which region it's running in.

    "I understand you want to change our approach for deploying the FinOps agent Lambda function based on the Strands Agents SDK documentation. Let's create a new plan that follows these deployment instructions more closely.\n\n## New Deployment Plan for FinOps Agent\n\nBased on the Strands documentation, here's what we'll do:\n\n1. Create a proper Lambda handler function\n2. Package the code correctly with dependencies in a Lambda layer\n3. Update our CloudFormation template to match the recommended approach\n\n### Step 1: Create a proper Lambda handler\n\nLet's create a new handler file that follows the pattern from the documentation:\n\n```python\n# lambda_handler.py\nfrom strands import Agent\nfrom strands_tools import calculator, current_time, python_repl\nimport boto3\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define our FinOps tool\ndef get_aws_cost_summary(time_period=\"MONTH_TO_DATE\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get a summary of AWS costs for the specified time period.\n    \n    Args:\n        time_period: The time period for the cost data (e.g., MONTH_TO_DATE, LAST_MONTH)\n        \n    Returns:\n        A summary of AWS costs\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the region from environment variable\n    region = os.environ.get('REGION', 'us-east-1')\n    ce = boto3.client('ce', region_name=region)\n    \n    # Define time period\n    end_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    \n    if time_period == \"MONTH_TO_DATE\":\n        start_date = datetime.now().replace(day=1).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    elif time_period == \"LAST_MONTH\":\n        first_of_month = datetime.now().replace(day=1)\n        last_month_end = first_of_month - timedelta(days=1)\n        start_date = last_month_end.replace(day=1).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n        end_date = last_month_end.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    else:\n        # Default to last 30 days\n        start_date = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    \n    try:\n        response = ce.get_cost_and_usage(\n            TimePeriod={\n                'Start': start_date,\n                'End': end_date\n            },\n            Granularity='MONTHLY',\n            Metrics=['UnblendedCost', 'UsageQuantity'],\n            GroupBy=[\n                {\n                    'Type': 'DIMENSION',\n                    'Key': 'SERVICE'\n                }\n            ]\n        )\n        \n        return {\n            'time_period': f\"{start_date} to {end_date}\",\n            'results': response['ResultsByTime']\n        }\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"error\": str(e)}\n\n# Define the FinOps system prompt\nFINOPS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a FinOps assistant for AWS.

We can avoid version conflicts that might occur during the packaging process\n3. We'll have an exact match between our development and deployment environments\n\nLet me check if our code works locally with the virtual environment:\n\n1.
